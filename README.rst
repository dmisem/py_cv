`My CV in RestructuredText <dsm/dsm.rst>`_

It was created for two reasons:

* to demonstrate python3 using;
* to present my CV in any formats.

Now it generates RestructuredText in format suitable for me. And converts to html using rst2html from docutils with default CSS.

ToDo
====

#. build for ditributing
#. Add docstrings
#. Add tests (there are tests only for one class as demo)
#. Create writers for Markdown, Postscript(pdf) and (maybe) dot(doc) formats.
